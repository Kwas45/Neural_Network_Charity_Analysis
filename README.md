# Neural Network Charity Analysis Overview

The purpose of this project create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. Alphabet Soup is a non-profit foundation dedicated to helping organizations that protect the environement, improve people's well being, and unify the world. This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables

> Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model

> Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model

> Optimize the Model

## Neural Network Charity Analysis Overview Results
**1. Data Preprocessing**

- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

The target of the model is considered to be the IS_SUCCESSFUL variable.

- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

The above image highlights the variables that are considered to be the features of the model.

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

The EIN and NAME variables are neither targets nor features, and are removed from the input. 

**2. Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model**
